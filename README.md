# lucky-message-pix

Send a pix to a pix key and receive a lucky message (Made for unit test integration with GerenciaNet PIX API)

## Status (:triangular_flag_on_post:)

Unfortunately the project is stopped, due to the non-existence of an endpoint in the **GerenciaNet** gateway to request the sending of a pix with a message.
